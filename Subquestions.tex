\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Hi! My name is Aarti Tandon and I am currently working as an
Undergraduate Research Assistant here at the University of Washington. I
work with the Pacific Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center
under the mentorship of Dr.~Eddie Kasner and Kit Galvin. This is my
markdown file that I have been working on this past year where I have
analyzed data from the `Bilingual Health and Safety Messaging'
application. My research is focused on reducing the gaps in fair and
equal access for marginalized peoples by understanding our user audience
and their preferences for app utility. While working on the app, I have
been able to stand at the crossroads of technology and human health.
Using the tools of statistics and data visualization, I have contributed
to research translation and the improvement of human health,
environmental resilience, and social and economic equity.

\section{Executive Summary}\label{executive-summary}}

The `Pesticides Labels Now!' mobile application strives to minimize
agricultural worker and community exposure and illness from agricultural
pesticides through improving access to pesticide labels and safety
information in Spanish and English. Pesticide handlers, managers, and
supervisors are able to gain access to this information, change
behaviors accordingly, and transfer the safety information to others. We
hypothesized that user characteristics such as language choice, mobile
device type, and location would determine frequency of interactions with
the application. This study investigates the application's user audience
and their preferences for app utility. Statistical analysis and graphing
was conducted with R Studio (Version 2021.09.1) for users accessing the
application over one year starting in August 2020. The raw data set
consisted primarily of users from the State of Washington, containing
67,754 interactions and a total of 503 unique users. The results showed
that user utilization is predominantly concentrated in central
Washington, which is part of the Columbia Basin, and has very productive
agricultural land. The overall frequency of each language accessed on
the application was relatively comparable - with 59\% in English and
41\% in Spanish. The analysis further indicated the majority of users
utilize the application through an iOS system. An estimated 74\% of
interactions were accessed through an iPhone device and 26\% were
accessed through an Android device. By understanding the effect of user
characteristics in their interaction with the application, necessary
adjustments can be made to the application to create a more
user-friendly experience and contribute to improving access to pesticide
labels and their safety information.

A data dictionary and descriptive statistics were prepared based on the
Pesticide Labels Now (PLN)
\href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUHPYdpWljCWroODGenUjYlyae2ZWwqN4MScBLXlr2U/edit}{analysis
plan}. For a better representation of users, we ignored a list of random
identifiers (`aid' in \emph{ignores.csv}) associated with the project
team members and generated descriptive statistics for three subsets:

In the United States, user utilization is predominantly concentrated in
Washington, however, there is scattered usage throughout the Eastern
coast and California.

  is opened.

  Location = GPS coordinates. de-identified location in that it is
  somewhere within the \textasciitilde{} 500 ft radius. We will only
  report by broad areas. Agricultural regions if they are defined.
  Currently, many iPhone users are declining location as Apple is asking
  users if they want the location turned on/off with each update. We may
  only be able to evaluate this up to the April release date. App is
  only available to devices registered in the US, CA, and MX. However,
  phones registered in these countries can be used anywhere. For
  example, we had a user connect from S. America from a US registered
  phone.

  Population A definition: anyone that has accessed the app. There is 1
  excluded population and 3 study subpopulations (based on gps location
  coordinates at time the app is opened.)

  \item
    Exclude. King County or at least the Seattle metropolitan area
    locations. These are likely team and PNASH staff. Exclusion list.
    Selected random devices IDs are on an exclusion list. These are test
    devices.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Population B definition: (Only use if enough people respond to in app
  questions). Those users that respond to the location in-app question.
  (This response can be linked to app analytic data as it has the same
  random unique ID). This will be implemented very soon.

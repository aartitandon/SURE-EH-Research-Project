# Executive Summary

A data dictionary and descriptive statistics were prepared based on the
Pesticide Labels Now (PLN) [analysis
plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUHPYdpWljCWroODGenUjYlyae2ZWwqN4MScBLXlr2U/edit).
For a better representation of users, we ignored a list of random
identifiers (‘aid’ in *ignores.csv*) associated with the project team
members and generated descriptive statistics for three subsets:

-   evDownload.01
-   evStart
-   evViewPage.01

## Detailed variable descriptions

-   Device = identified by a randomly assigned identifier. = Person.
    Person = device. There is no way to distinguish individual users.
    One device can be used by ≥ 1 person and 1 person can use ≥ 1
    device.
-   Access = accessed app = put PLN on device and opened app (app opens
    to label List).
-   Session = time from when the app opened until just before next time
    it is opened.
-   PICOL Searches = PICOL results viewed.
-   Label searches = Label menu viewed.
-   View = accessed and viewed information (any combination of ≥ 1 of
    the following)
-   Label view = accessed + \[(opened ≥ 1 label) + (opened ≥ 1 menu
    bar)\] Label view + PDF = accessed + \[(opened ≥ 1 label) + (opened
    ≥ 1 menu bar)+ (downloaded label PDF)\]
-   PICOL view = accessed + \[(conducted ≥ 1 PICOL search) + (viewed ≥ 1
    PICOL result)\]
-   PICOL view + PDF = accessed app + \[(conducted ≥ 1 PICOL search) +
    (viewed ≥ 1 PICOL result) + (downloaded app)\]
-   General view = accessed +(viewed label search page + selected a
    label, but did not open menu bar) and/or ( viewed PICOL search page)
    and/or viewed more pages General view + links
-   Location = GPS coordinates. de-identified location in that it is
    somewhere within the ~ 500 ft radius. We will only report by broad
    areas. Agricultural regions if they are defined. Currently, many
    iPhone users are declining location as Apple is asking users if they
    want the location turned on/off with each update. We may only be
    able to evaluate this up to the April release date. App is only
    available to devices registered in the US, CA, and MX. However,
    phones registered in these countries can be used anywhere. For
    example, we had a user connect from S. America from a US registered
    phone.
-   Population A definition: anyone that has accessed the app. There is
    1 excluded population and 3 study subpopulations (based on gps
    location coordinates at time the app is opened.)
    -   Device used in WA state GPS data. (Not Seattle or King County)
    -   Device used outside of WA state
    -   No location (location services are off.)
    -   Exclude. King County or at least the Seattle metropolitan area
        locations. These are likely team and PNASH staff. Exclusion
        list. Selected random devices IDs are on an exclusion list.
        These are test devices.
-   Population B definition: (Only use if enough people respond to in
    app questions). Those users that respond to the location in-app
    question. (This response can be linked to app analytic data as it
    has the same random unique ID). This will be implemented very soon.
    -   Response I work in WA state (not quite the same as where they
        downloaded it)
    -   Response I work outside of Washington state
    -   Do not want to answer
    -   Skips answering the question. (will combine with c)
